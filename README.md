## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a **market-depth-analyzer** integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Core Concept: What is a Market-Depth-Analyzer?

Before discussing integration, it's crucial to understand what it is. A market depth analyzer is a software tool that processes the **Order Book** (a real-time list of all open buy and sell orders for an asset) to generate actionable trading signals.

*   **Order Book:** Comprises:
    *   **Bids:** Prices at which traders are willing to buy.
    *   **Asks:** Prices at which traders are willing to sell.
*   **Analysis:** The analyzer calculates metrics like:
    *   **Support/Resistance Levels:** Large clusters of bids (support) and asks (resistance).
    *   **Order Book Imbalance:** Whether buy-side or sell-side liquidity is heavier, indicating short-term price pressure.
    *   **Wall Detection:** Identifying very large individual orders that can act as a price magnet or barrier.
    *   **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) within the depth:** Understanding the true cost to execute a large order.
